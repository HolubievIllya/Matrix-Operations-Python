# Matrix-Operations-Python

The code provides a collection of functions for matrix operations, including transposing, finding the rank, inverting, multiplying.

## About

<ul>
  <li>transpose_matrix - this function takes a matrix as input and returns its transpose, where the rows of the original matrix become columns in the transposed matrix, and vice versa</li>
  <li>rank_of_matrix - this function calculates and returns the rank of a matrix, which is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in the matrix</li>
  <li>inverse_matrix - this function computes and returns the inverse of a square matrix. It checks if the matrix is invertible, and if so, it performs Gaussian elimination to find the inverse</li>
  <li>multiply_matrix - this function multiplies each element of a matrix by an integer n and returns the resulting matrix</li>
  <li>exponentiate_matrix - this function raises a square matrix to the power of an integer n. It performs repeated matrix multiplication of the matrix with itself n times and returns the resulting matrix</li>
  <li>read_matrix_from_file - reads matrix from a txt file, matrix should look like in an example file</li>
</ul>
You can utilize this code to perform various operations. Additionally, you have the flexibility to add your own custom methods as needed.
